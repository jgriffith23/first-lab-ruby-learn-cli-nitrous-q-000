Hello, first lab! :)

In case anyone's reading this, I couldn't see the "Open" buttons in my
lab (still can't), but I did manage to get my Nitrous environment set up
by installing several gems from Learn.co's GitHub. I might suggest
making the environment setup process a bit more explicit somewhere, as
I'm still not certain how I was supposed to set everything up.

Cheers!
